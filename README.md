# Chessweeper

The code for the game I did for fun. https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/qycj3o/is_there_a_way_to_avoid_this/

This uses my library QPL (https://github.com/DanielRabl/QPL).

For Visual Studio, If you setup a fresh project and setup the library, copy the src folder, resources folder and the .dlls files to project it will compile in the game I showed on the reddit link.

If expanded it probably should have a mode to set the difficulty and board size.

other ideas from reddit:
- put the checkmate sign on the triggered mine (by u/afonsoel)
